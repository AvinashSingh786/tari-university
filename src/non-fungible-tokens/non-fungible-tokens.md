# Non-fungible Tokens

From [<u>**Wikipedia**</u>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token)

A non-fungible token (NFT) is a special type of cryptographic token which represents something unique; non-fungible tokens are thus not interchangeable. This is in contrast to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, and many network or utility tokens that are fungible in nature. NFTs are used to create verifiable digital scarcity, for example in several specific applications that require unique digital items like crypto-collectibles and crypto-gaming.

A non-fungible tokens (NFT) are blockchain tokens that are designed to be wholly and distinguishable from each other. Using unique metadata, avatars, individual token IDs, and custody chains, NFTs are created to ensure that no two NFT tokens are identical. This is because they exist to store information rather than value, unlike their fungible counterparts.
