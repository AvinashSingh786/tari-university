# Cryptography

From <u>[**Wikipedia**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography)</u>

Cryptography or cryptology (from Ancient Greek: κρυπτός, kryptós "hidden, secret"; and γράφειν graphein, "to write", or -λογία -logia, "study", respectively) is the practice and study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of third parties called adversaries. More generally, cryptography is about constructing and analyzing protocols that prevent third parties or the public from reading private messages; various aspects in information security such as data confidentiality, data integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation are central to modern cryptography.

From <u>[**SearchSecurity**](https://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/cryptography)</u>

Cryptography is a method of protecting information and communications through the use of codes so that only those for whom the information is intended can read and process it. The pre-fix "crypt" means "hidden" or "vault" and the suffix "graphy" stands for "writing."
